        <h1> Spicy Turkey Stir Fry</h1>
        <img src ="../img/turkey.jpeg" alt="A beautifully garnished bowl of spicy turkey stir fry with crisp ginger and garlic">
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This quick-cooking stir-fry is packed with umami from fish sauce and soy sauce, and heat from both red-pepper flakes and fresh chile. 
            Pungent and herbal, it’s a terrific weeknight dish that’s fast but never bland. 
            The key here is to let the turkey get deeply brown, so don’t move it around in the pan too much. 
            Serve it over rice for a substantial meal, or a bed of crisp lettuce if you want something lighter.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 tbsp neutral oil, divided</li>
            <li>4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>2-inch knob ginger, cut into matchsticks</li>
            <li>fine sea salt</li>
            <li>3 scallions, white and green parts seperated, thily sliced</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp red pepper flakes, plus more to taste</li>
            <li>1 lb ground turkey, preferably dark meat</li>
            <li>2 tbsp lime juice, plus more to taste</li>
            <li>1 tbsp fish sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp soy sauce, plus more to taste</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp sugar or honey</li>
            <li>cooked stick or white rice, for serving</li>
            <li>2/3 cup cilantro, for serving</li>
            <li>1/3 cup torn basil leaves</li>
            <li>1 fresh serrano chile, thinly sliced</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a cold 12-inch skillet, combine oil, garlic and ginger. 
                Place over medium heat until sizzling, then continue to cook, stirring frequently, until garlic and ginger are golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes. 
                Transfer with a slotted spoon to a paper towel-lined plate and sprinkle lightly with salt.</li>

            <li>Add oil to pan, then stir in scallion whites and cook until starting to brown, about 2 minutes. 
                Stir in red-pepper flakes and cook for 1 minute.</li>

            <li>Stir in turkey, raise heat to medium-high, and cook, breaking up meat with a spoon, until golden and crisp, about 7 minutes. 
                Don’t stir the meat too much, so it can turn deep brown.</li>

            <li>Remove pan from heat and stir in lime juice, fish sauce and soy sauce. 
                Taste and add more lime juice, red-pepper flakes, soy sauce and sugar or honey if you like.</li>

            <li>Gently mix about two-thirds of the fried garlic and ginger into the turkey. 
                Serve turkey over rice, topped with cilantro, basil, scallion greens and fresh chile, and garnished with remaining fried ginger and garlic.</li>
        </ol>
